    "Eris leaves her half empty glass on the table and struts off towards the customers, leaving me all by myself in my corner with Parker."
    roman "So? What is it?"

    parker "No offense."

    roman "Huh? Of course I did. I planned this whole event, you know I'll be on top of things."

    "I try reading it in Parker's eyes if he's joking, or if he means that in some kind of tricky way."
    "He's as inscrutable as he'd ever wanted to be."
    "I look around again, just to check."
    "It looks like everyone's having a good time. People are drinking. People are talking. People are over by the pool table. It all looks fine to me."

    parker "Right. Okay. Let's stop there. People are drinking, you say? Can you tell me what?"
    roman "Well, it {i}is{/i}, not to stress this too much, a whiskey tasting evening, so I'd say whiskey, no?"
    "Parker stands silently in front of me, eyes boring into my very soul."
    parker "Among other things."
    roman "Well, obviously. This is still a club, they're free to order whatever they like. It all averages out in the end, though."
    roman "I {i}personally{/i} served nine customers this night's special whiskey already. And I bet you and Eris did some, too."
    roman "Besides, we've only just started. Once people have gotten comfortable, I'm sure they'll--"
    parker "Roman, listen to me."
    parker "You said yourself that this is my specialty, didn't you?"
    parker "And you know what? You're right. I'm a bartender. I know a thing or two about drinks."
    parker "For example, I have a general idea of how much drinks tend to cost."
    parker "Now, I don't know what kind of 'authentic', 'cool' boutique place you got all that whiskey in, but that doesn't change the fact whiskey tends to have a certain price."
    parker "As it happens, I'm {i}also{/i} the guy paying your salary."
    parker "So unless you really {i}are{/i} moonlighting as a drug dealer behind my back on top of doing that job, I'm going to hazard a guess and say you haven't spent less that a month's wages on the booze for today."
    roman "Yeah, but this was all to show Eris--"
    parker "Roman! This is {i}a lot{/i} of money to throw at a stupid, childish bet. It's {i}way, way{/i} too much money."
    roman "But it'll pay itself back! People are buying the whiskey, and we're making a profit off of each glass!"
    parker "Off of each glass, yes, but you bought enough whiskey to fill a bathtub!"

    parker "To you, this whiskey is 'old-school' and 'hip' and whatever it you're thinking. That's fine."
    parker "To most of these people, though?"
    parker "This is going to sound terrible, but as a bartender, I can tell you for a fact that to most of those people, your expensive, gold label, real-deal whiskey is {i}just another drink{/i}."
    parker "It's tasty and it's nice, but you know what else is? Eris' awful kiwi mojitos. Or Mexican corn beer, for that matter."
    roman "Wh--come on, it can't be that--"
    parker "Please don't argue with me. You know that I hate sounding like that."
    parker "I'm just telling you how things are. As the guy who's getting all of the tabs."
    roman "And?"
    parker "And as I've said, people aren't buying your special whiskey. Not anymore than they buy anything else, anyway."
    parker "So as I see it, it's {i}not{/i} going to pay back for itself. Not even remotely. This isn't even mentioning how very unlikely it is that this event will draw in more people."
    "Parker sighs."
    parker "I really care about you, guy. I'm only doing this because I do."
    roman "...doing what?"
    parker "Telling you this: your special whiskey night? I think we should call it off. Early as possible."
    roman "Call it off?! But I've already--"
    parker "Third time, Roman: this isn't up for discussion. Arcady is still my club, you are still my employee, and my decision about this is final."

    parker "I like your spirit. I like your attitude. I like how you...talk about things most people nowadays couldn't care less about."
    parker "And part of that means I like you enough to see you making a very stupid decision that you're going to regret ten days from now, just because you're currently hyper-focused on something Eris told you three days ago."
    "I lay the glass down. Maybe it's the alcohol, but..."
    "It really feels like I've just had all the wind knocked out of me."
    roman "How about the pool table, though?"
    parker "Yeah, about that..."
    parker "I want you to look over it again and tell me what you see."
    roman "Can we... can we not do this again?"
    parker "Alright. Then I'll tell you what I'm seeing: I'm seeing people checking out the huge-ass 3D printed monstrosity you've tucked right in the middle of my club in place of three tables I could put customers in."
    parker "I'm seeing them giggling to themselves because they never saw one in real life, then I'm seeing them picking a cue up, fumbling with it for two minutes trying to hit a ball, and then going back to their tables to laugh it off with a beer."
    roman "Don't be so harsh. It can't be that bad. I've seen them myself. It's fine."
    parker "Listen: I'm saying this as a friend."
    parker "When someone wants to see something, odds are they're going to see it."
    parker "And I think that right now, you're seeing what you want to see. You have been all night."
    parker "People aren't having fun with that pool table. All that thing embodies is a distraction."
    roman "...that's just because they just don't understand real pool. It's not like AR, it's got weight, it's got--"
    parker "It's got a lot of stuff these people just don't {i}care about{/i}."
    parker p1 e4 "You've tried your best and it's great. But you've gone overboard."
    parker "This has to end. Now."
    "Parker leans against the wall, looking about an eighth as tired as I'm feeling all of a sudden."
    "It's astonishing how quiet it can feel inside a club full of people when you're like this."
    "I open after a tiny eternity."
    roman "What do you want me to do?"
    parker p1 e1 "First of all, don't worry about telling people about this. I'll handle this, okay?"
    parker "We let the customers have another order of whiskey if they want to. Close the tap on that slowly."
    parker "Then, we're going to take every bottle we haven't had to open yet--and lucky for you that's the vast, vast majority of them--and we're going to put it out in the back."
    parker "What I want you to do is, as soon as tomorrow morning, pack them back into the crates you got them in and return them to the store. See if you can get a refund."
    parker "If you're having any trouble with that, call me. I'll do my very best to make sure that you get as much of your money back as you can."
    "Without even noticing it, I've gone from looking ahead at the crowd to staring at my own feet."
    "I can't even see them, in the dark. It's pretty pointless."
    "I feel like I'm a high school kid all over again, only this time {i}actually{/i} being scolded for fucking up. "
    parker "I'm also going to have you take apart that pool table. It's a serious eyesore."
