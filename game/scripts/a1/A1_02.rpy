    parker p1 e5 "Wise words. Mind you live by them."
    "He fixes me with a knowing stare for a beat, before continuing."
    parker p1 e1 "I am surprised to hear you and Eris have such a turbulent history, to be honest. I didn't really expect anything like this to happen when I was bringing her on board, even when I mentioned you during our interview."
    parker p1 e3 "Though I probably shouldn't talk about that with you."
    "He hastens to fix his slip-up--but I'm not about to let that go."
    roman "You mentioned me to Eris before she started? What did she say?"
    parker p1 e1 "I just said, I can't talk about that with you. It's private."
    roman "I don't think it's against any employment law, right? Considering the circumstances--and if you spoke about me, surely I have the right to know what it was about?"
    "I hardly have an in-depth knowledge of employment law--though I'm hoping Parker has very little understanding as well."
    "That or a kind heart."
    parker p1 e4 "Well..."
    parker p1 e1 "All right, all right. I just mentioned your name, in passing--you know, when mentioning some of the staff during her hiring interview--and when I came to your name, she sort of... fixated on it."
    roman "And?"
    parker "We didn't really linger on the subject. She said that she worked with you before, and that you were a, eh... what was it, now..."
    parker "Actually, she just sort of trailed off."
    "Coming to his senses, some sharpness returns to his voice."
    parker p1 e4 "Not that {i}this{/i} is any of {i}your{/i} business."
    "But I've heard all I need to know."
    "I don't know what I expected."
    "Should I be offended about her choice of words describing me? Is it that she hardly cares, or was what she had to say too rude for Parker to repeat?"
    parker p1 e1 "I don't expect any trouble to come of this, Roman. Eris is now as valued here as you are."
    "He says this firmly, but not unkindly. Not exactly kindly, either."
    parker "Let's get back to it, then. The crowd will be arriving soon."
