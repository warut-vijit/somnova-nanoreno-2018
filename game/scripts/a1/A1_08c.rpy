    eris p2 e4 "I was able to finish things up from last night. Wanna go over these again?"
    roman "Sure thing. Did you test things beforehand?"
    eris p1 e1 "Yeah. The platform does most of the work, but I really want to make sure."
    roman "Well no problem but..."
    "A question has been circulating around my head as of late."
    roman "Why are you involving me so much?"
    roman "Don't get me wrong, I don't mind helping out."
    eris "Hm?"
    roman "It just seems like we're working far more closely then we ever did at ARTech."
    roman "What changed?"
    "She takes a moment, looking as if she's trying to take in the question thoughtfully."
    eris "Well..."
    eris "I was thinking about the last night we talked, actually."
    eris "What you said, about me not trusting you in the past..."
    "She shifts her body to stand a little taller."
    eris p1 e6 "I want to change that part of me. Starting right now, I want to be able to trust you...and I hope you'll be able to trust me."
    "I see."
    roman "That's..."
    "That's a huge leap for her. Knowing her, this isn't something that she'd be able to say lightly." 
    show eris p1 e1 at centered
    "However..."
    "...would this be a change that could last?"
    eris "Roman?"
    "I realize that I'm just starting into oblivion at this point, and graciously accept the controls she's handing over to me."
    roman "Uh--nothing."
    roman "Thinking about something else. Here, let me take a look."
    "It'll just take a moment."
    "..."
    "..."
    "Everything looks to be in place. She did a thorough job; and most likely, she double-checked things already."
    "Still, it feels great to have her involve me on the project. It almost feels like a 'what could have been' at ARTech." 
    roman "Looks good to me. You did a good job making sure the audio output is hooked up."
    eris p1 e6 "I appreciate it!"
    eris p1 e1 "Want to run a live test with me real quick?"
    roman "Sure. We have some time before things get busy."
    eris "Okay, stay here for a minute and I'll hop on stage."

    "Eris quickly climbs up to the stage and prepares herself in the center."
    "From her enthusiastic outlook it almost looks as if she's about ready to start one of her performances."
    eris "Okay, I'm testing the mics. Can you check levels?"
    roman "On it."
    eris "Testing, one, two..."
    eris "Testing, one, two..."
    roman "Levels seem fine. No spikes or anything."
    eris "Okay, any buzzing or distortion?"
    roman "Nada."
    eris "Great, let me just do a few more tests here..."
    "She tests each of the instruments on stage and makes sure they're registered correctly to the AR platform."
    "To my surprise, they all work with no issues."
    show eris p1 e1 at centered
    eris "That's a first."
    roman "Seems like you tested it quite thoroughly before I came in."
    eris "Well..."
    eris "I mean, usually if something's working perfectly the first time, it's a sign that something's bound to go wrong."
    roman "With coding, sure. I'd always be paranoid that I overlooked something with my work and double check with another co-worker that I hadn't screwed something up."
    roman "But from what I've seen you've done a great job without my help."
    "She gives me an uncertain look, though I'm not really sure why."
    eris p1 e2 "You had people double check your work when you were at ARTech?"
    roman "It was practically a {i}requirement{/i} at ARTech."
    show eris p1 e1 at centered
    roman "Whether at a high-profile company or somewhere like here, I guess it's healthy to check in with someone."
    eris "That's strange."
    eris "I always just took you for someone who always knew what they were doing. Someone who would just efficiently check their work and move onto the next task."
    eris "I really looked up to you because of that, though I guess that kind of expectation wasn't really fair on your part."
    "I shudder."
    roman "No one's that perfect you know."
    roman "Though I think I have a better idea as to why you overworked me so much."
    eris "..."
    roman "..."
    roman "Well, whatever right? We're working together now and that amounts to something."
    eris "..."
    eris "...yeah, whatever."
    eris p1 e6 "This system works and was just validated by you, so I don't see a problem."
    roman "I'll still verify the working code again to make sure problems don't occur down the line."
    roman "Aside from that though..."
    show eris p1 e2
    eris "Any other tests you think we need to run?"
    roman "Hmm..."
    roman "Nah. I really think you have things well covered from here."
    eris p1 e6 "Well, alright!"
    eris "Thanks again for your help, Roman."
    eris "I really appreciate it."
    roman "No problem."
    "This kind of praise is still strange coming from Eris, but I accept it with a smile nonetheless."
    "Even if she might be trying a little too hard, it's still a nice sentiment."
    roman "I'm gonna get ready for my shift, so I'll catch you later."
    eris "Later!"

    "Thankfully, I don't really have to do much to prepare. Today's shift isn't anything out the ordinary."
    "There are no big performances scheduled, or any special events for that matter, so there aren't as many people to worry about right now."
    "I let another staffer manage the regulars and decide to take the time to simply clean up the empty tables during this lull in activity."
    "All the while I simply focus on the newfound comfort that's settling within me."

    "Parker looks a little far too enthusiastic than usual."
    roman "We just had a monthly meeting, didn't we? The one me and Eris were apart of?"

    "Ah, he's gonna be talking about how poorly Eris and I messed up our attempts."

    parker "Roman and Eris! Great job, you two!"
    "He starts applauding for us, with the rest of the workers following suit."
    roman "...What?"
    eris p1 e10 "What is this Parker, a new sense of pity for your employees?"
    parker "This month's award goes to the both of you."
    parker p1 e1 "Even after failing with your initial ideas, the two of you continued working towards Arcady's improvement, and because of that I've felt that the two of you truly deserve some appreciation."
    "He fishes out a small metal plaque with both our names on it."
    roman "Really, a trophy?"
    roman "Now I know this is a joke."
    "I still can't help but beam from ear to ear, and I can see that Eris is wearing the same reaction on her face."
    parker "I'll be sure to get this hung up on the office wall so you two can gloat about it later."
