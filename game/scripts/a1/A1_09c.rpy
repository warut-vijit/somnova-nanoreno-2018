    "For the first time in my life, I'm not worried about the time that's being 'wasted' working at Arcady."
    "Whether it's the atmosphere, the new surge of customers, or even my relationships with the staff, I never expected every day to be a privilege ..."

    roman "Morning, Parker."

    roman "I'm just doing what you asked me to."
    roman "I'm still only a thirty minute walk away from here otherwise."
    parker "Oh, the joys of being young..." 
    "The club owner lets out a sad chuckle, shaking his head back and forth."

    parker p1 e1 "So, I take it you picked up what I asked?"
    roman "Yeah... it wasn't too hard." 
    roman "I certainly received a few strange looks though."
    "I grab the crate of bottles from the back seat of my car and pass it over to Parker, who accepts it graciously."

    parker p1 e1 "Grab the backdoor for me?"

    roman "You're not poking fun at me here, are you?" 
    parker "Did your whiskey night sour your taste for the drink?"
    roman "Well no, but... I would've bought my own bottle, right?"
    "Not much of a gift, but it's the thought that counts."
    parker "I would consider the cash I transferred you a sufficient enough payment..."

    roman "Yeah..."
    "She's now eyeing me with a hint of concern, then sports her usual shit-eating grin--one I know all too well."
    eris "You look really out of it; I thought you'd at least be the perkier one on a morning shift."
    "Her eyes flash over to the bottles on the bar counter, her grin fading into curiosity."
    eris "What's with the alcohol?"
    eris "Wait, is that...?"
    "I place my bottle next to the crate and pull out another, then pass it to Eris."

    "As usual, we're outside, in the same back alley, next to the same club, feeling the same air." 
    "It's just a normal day--but of course, everything is different."
    "I take a long puff from a cigarette I really shouldn't be smoking and stare absentmindedly at my nearby car."
    "There's a long silence between me and Eris--though it doesn't feel awkward or hostile at this point."
    "Being in each other's company has just become a way of life at this point."
    "In the end, I'm the one that ends up breaking the silence."
    roman "So what's up, Eris? Why are you in the club on a Thursday morning, acting like everything is normal?"
    eris "Isn't it? We're doing the same thing we usually do."
    roman "I'm pretty sure we've never smoked {i}before{/i} work. I'm used to colder air out here." 
    eris "Well..."
    "She takes in a big breath, as if preparing for some big announcement." 
    eris p1 e6 "I quit ARTech."
    "I nearly choke on my cigarette and clutch the paper a little too tightly, then turn over to Eris--who's nonchalantly blowing smoke towards the sky."
    eris p3 e8 "So that's my news..."
    roman "What do you mean?"
    eris p2 e3 "What do you mean 'what do you mean?' I quit! Do you need me to spell it out for you?"
    roman "You know what I mean, Eris. ARTech was your life... In fact, it's what made me--"
    "Quit as well."
    "The words catch in my throat, but I'm sure she caught onto what I was referring to."
    "That passion and drive to succeed in the company was a double-edged sword.But to see her throw it all away so casually would mean..."
    roman "You found another AR job?"
    show eris p1 e1 at centered
    "She nods." 
    eris "I knew I couldn't revive the Greenway project without your help, and I wasn't about to start another one so soon."
    eris "The biggest reason, though, was that I knew I never could work two jobs."
    eris "I know I can't... but that's OK."
    "Something about this just doesn't feel right..."
    roman "Well then."
    roman "When are you leaving Arcady?"
    eris p1 e2 "Huh?"
    roman "The second AR job... When do you start working at it?"
    roman "I mean, I'm a little disappointed that you're leaving when I..."
    "The words catch in my throat as with this morning, and I'm not sure how I want to say it."
    "As I'm trying to search for the words, she gives me a surprised look."
    eris p1 e1 "Don't tell me you're about to confess your love to me."
    "Another cough escapes my mouth."
    roman "{i}No!{/i} that's not--! Uh..."

    eris p1 e6 "Pfft."
    eris p1 e10 "Ahahaha!"
    "Her laugh echoes against the walls..."
    roman "Eris, that's not what I was trying to say."
    eris p1 e6 "I'm sorry, I couldn't help it."
    eris "But I figured something was up."
    eris p1 e1 "So...?"
    roman "Parker is gifting the whiskey that I bought for him to the staff, though it turns out... he overpaid me."
    eris "By how much?"
    roman "A lot. Enough to leave Arcady--and even the city."
    eris p1 e2 "I see."
    eris p1 e1 "Well... that should be great, right?"
    eris "It's all you ever talked about while working at ARTech. It's all Parker talked about, too..." 
    roman "Parker talked about me leaving Arcady?"
    eris p1 e2 "Uh..."
    eris "Well he mentioned certain staff members being temporary hires; I just assumed-- I knew you wouldn't be staying is all."
    eris "But this was all only temporary in the end, right?"
    roman "Yeah..."
    "I breathe in and exhale a big puff of cigarette smoke--but somehow, it just doesn't taste the same as it used to."
    roman "That's just it."
    roman "Things were {i}always{/i} supposed to be temporary."
    roman "Now I have what I want--and since you're leaving Arcady, there isn't really a reason for me to stick around."
    roman "All my life I've been against routine, so I guess it's weird that I..."
    roman "I don't want to leave."
    "It feels good to say out loud."
    roman "I mean... wow, a fucking {i}jazz club{/i} of all places."
    roman "I've always been trying to find something to just desperately latch onto, and--{i}this{/i} is it." 
    eris "..."
    roman "So... what? Is it bad that I'm never going back to ARTech so I can work here?"
    roman "Is it okay that I don't care about that at all?"
    roman "I have a good thing going here, so..."
    roman "I'll be sad to see you go."
    eris "..."
    eris "Well... you don't have to be {i}that{/i} sad."
    eris "Worst case scenario, Parker just sets us on different days, right?"
    roman "What are you talking about?"
    eris "Roman, I'm not working a Thursday morning because I quit ARTech. {i}This{/i} is the AR job that I found--or, well, had."
    eris "Parker offered me a higher paying full-time position a while back, and I finally decided to take him up on his offer."
    roman "You..."
    roman "You're staying, then?"
    eris p3 e3 "What, do think I'm that bad of singer?"
    eris p1 e1 "I actually heard from Parker that I now have a loyal following. I might not even have to work tables anymore."
    "She blows a puff of smoke into the air, and a look of soft nostalgia crosses her face."
    eris "AR improvements, though... who knows?"
    "The look leaves her quickly though, replaced by a usual grin as she knocks an elbow into my side."
    eris p1 e10 "So spill it, you really think my last performance was that bad, huh?"
    "I can't keep the smile from my face, I know quite well how obvious her teasing is. If she didn't know me at this point, maybe it would have actually looked like I was making fun of her."
    roman "Of course not."

    eris p1 e10 "You might make Parker jealous after all." 
    "The two of us share a smile, and then a laugh. Soon enough, Parker unavoidably becomes the topic of our conversation."
    eris "So where does he get all that money, anyway?"
    roman "A secret lover, perhaps? I wouldn't put it past him..."
    eris "Or maybe he's loaded and is just running Arcady for fun?"

    "It's not like I forgot the event that would start the foundation of our relationship."
    roman "Our employee of the month competition... Parker started that because he wanted more revenue for the club, right?"
    show eris p1 e1
    "She nods, now understanding where I'm coming from."
    roman "So why would he..."
    "Why would he set up a competition that didn't need to happen?"
    "After all, if he needed the money then all of his generosity wouldn't have really made sense up to this point."
    "And if he really wanted us to avoid fighting, then why would he purposefully put us together, rather than schedule our shifts far apart?"
    "Was it really due to Eris's conflicting schedule?"
    "Or maybe--just maybe--he tried to do the best thing that no one had ever tried for us."
    "He taught us how to listen."
    eris p1 e6 "We should really thank him."
    roman "Yeah..."
    "Or maybe we were just reading too far into things?"
