    "And at the same time, unless I'm paying attention, it feels like life's passing me by in a blur."
    "I come to work in the evening, spend what feels like an age and a half waiting tables and cleaning the floor and listening to Eris' singing and wondering how much of it is recorded, then bam, it's morning, and in retrospect, all that time implodes into one instant 'nothing got done.'"

    "Eris, of all people, should know on what terms I left ARTech, and why."
    "She was the one who tried to stop me. More than anyone."
    "Which, by itself, makes the whole situation feel strange since a little, irrational bit of my mind keeps wondering whether this is some kind of scam--"
    "Some stupid, childish plan of hers to get me to suddenly realize that, actually, there's nothing I love in the world more than spending two hours straight down on my knees with my head shoved inside the ass of a mainframe, clutching a flashlight between my teeth and wondering who the fuck did it and what they could possibly have done to melt that connection like fudge."
    "That my destiny's been to do that for the rest of my life."
    "Eris bites on her lower lip, first in what looks like despair, then, slowly, anger."

    roman "Then what? You're going to send me home knowing I've left you here to wear yourself thin for the rest of the night, fiddling with an area you don't know the first thing about? Do you think you could willpower your way through a computer engineering degree in six hours?"
    roman "Get some sleep, watch some shows, then come back here tomorrow and look you in the eye?"

    "If nothing else, things get a lot more hectic from that day on."
    "The first stage's easy: just a couple nights of sitting around with Eris searching the web for affordable, energy and heat efficient bits of infrastructure that we could conceivably install by ourselves to get the kind of all-around upgrade she had in mind out of this."
    "The most tired I get around this part's my arm cramping up from having to hold up my phone at all times so I can see the AR windows she's viewing."
    "We get around that once she asks Parker for one of those comfy chairs, with armrests, so I can sorta awkwardly place my elbow on it and only get wrist cramps, instead."
    "At first, I'm worried we might not able to pay for some of the stuff that immediately popped to my mind once Eris started describing the sort of system overhaul she wanted, but then I found out two things:"
    "First, it really has been a while since I've looked around those computer part catalogues. Eris might not know the first thing about how to work with them but I'll give her that: she did do her homework fine."
    "It's kind of sickening how fast technology progresses. You have it in your mind that this one process's impossible to pull off at all without either getting a new radiator or shutting the whole system down every three hours so you won't liquify the customers."
    "Then Eris points me to this webstore, and they got this chip that does it and only needs to be turned off for cooling every {i}two{/i} hours. Assuming we don't want to shell it out for the cryotanks, which we don't."
    "Second: Eris actually offered to pay out of her own pocket for everything I thought was good, so I could go wild. At first I thought I'd show her for it and just order a truckload of fans or something, but, I mean, she {i}was{/i} pretty nice about it."
