    "The hours kept running like wax."
    "Eris's big upgrade couldn't have taken that long, but there you had it. I'd taken my eyes off the clock and the next time I knew it, minutes all added up into months."
    "Concentrated, pure, distilled essence of wasted opportunities and nothing."
    "So dense I don't even dare to disturb the thought. I don't want to know how it'll look like if it went and exploded. What it'll do to the rest of my sense of reality."
    "I need a smoke. Gotta get this shit out of my mind."
    roman "Yo, Parker?"

    "He spares me a quiet glance, bottle of synthequila still steadily held in one hand and glass still secure in the other. The customer wouldn't have even seen it."

    "He nods. Amidst the shadows of the neon lights shifting across his face, my mind conjures a thin, but comforting smile."
    "I head for the back door."
    "It occurs to me that when I first arrived, I would inadvertently try to avoid getting in people's line of sight of the stage. I'd take the long way, behind the tables. Sometimes flattened against the wall."
    "But now I shouldn't have bothered. I certainly don't need to anymore"
    "The customers are barely aware I exist. Their blank gazes all rapturously fixed on the emitters we've scattered throughout."
    "They look so dumb sitting like this. Staring at the walls."
    "Submerging themselves in the virtual fucking wonderland I've gone and turned this place into."

    "I should be happy. Parker almost looked like he did my first day, and that's about as much as you can hope for from him."
    "We've just about multiplied profits in the span of a season. The customers keep pouring in. We got everything now: virtual band, virtual wallpaper, virtual music. None of that pesky 'reality'."
    "They buy drinks, they spend money, they tell their friends, rinse and repeat."
    "Parker gave Eris and I a raise and a bonus. I think hers was bigger--she was the one who 'showed initiative', after all. I didn't mind it. Mine was nice all the same."
    "Everything's right with the world. We've won."

    "My movements are fast and automatic. The cigarette's lit and held between my teeth before I'd so much as noticed taking it out of the packet."
    "I inhale, lean back, and try to float off and away to the zen of not giving a shit."
    "Watching, feeling a million miles away, the whorls of smoke rising lazily up in the air like transparent, abyssal fish. Flakes of ash drifting down in a sluggish and shadowy dance."
    "Closing one eye--"
    "Looking at them, down there, squinting at just the right angle--"
    "I can almost imagine seeing them falling into the beginning of a drawn, white-gray circle. Obviously, nothing but smoke is really there." 
    "My mind's just... desperate for it, I guess. Screaming at me to acknowledge a pattern in the air."
    "It's a cheesy, pretentious fuck, like that."

    "When I first came here, I thought I'd finally found a place where I could belong."
    "Elegant. Classy. Old-school. Someplace where they cared about the same things I did."
    "The utter, complete opposite of ARTech."
    "I should've been happy here. It should have made me feel whole. I should've been able to enjoy this for years and years and years on end."
    "Then Eris had to come and drag ARTech all the way out here behind her."
    roman "Jesus. What's up with me today."
    "Experimentally, like it actually matters, I push one foot forward and break a half-formed circle of ash that has fallen to the floor. The flakes rise up into the air in a tiny, gray cloud, then evaporate off into nothing."
    "It doesn't do anything. I don't even know what got into me to imagine that it somehow would."

    "Her first few steps are slow and cautious, like she's waiting for me to pull out a knife and lunge at her. Then she stops, takes a deep breath, regains her composure and stands up next to me, like normal."
    "She pulls out that disgusting e-cig of hers. Within moments, the whole alley fills with the sickening aroma of burnt cherry syrup."
    roman "So?"
    eris p1 e2 "...So?"

    eris p1 e1 "So..."
    eris "Two things I thought I should say to you. To start, anyway."
    "What's with that show? Either she's won the lottery and trying to rub it in, she just found out she's dying, or she's playing some sort of game. I don't like two of those options."
    "Deciding to play it cool, I shrug and just motion for her to continue."
    eris p1 e2 "First: I wanted to say that I'm sorry."
    "Alright. That was unexpected."
    "I suppose that does deserve me looking at her in the eyes."
    roman "Okay."
    roman "What for?"
    eris p3 e8 "For the past few months, and all that. Mostly the big project I dragged you into, but, like, counting the whole other time, as well."
    eris "I know that you came here because you hated it in ARTech, and I should've known you wouldn't like this any better."
    eris "Plus... I {i}guess{/i} you could say that I was kind of a hardass about it. You did a good job and I mostly just sat there complaining."
    eris p2 e7 "I was selfish. I admit it."
    "A silence stretches between us, one that she tries to break."
    eris "That takes some guts, doesn't it? Doesn't happen every day that I can admit I was wrong."

    "My mind's still working the sentence over."
    "If she'd been another person and this had been another situation, I'd just blurt out one of those automatic 'okay, I forgive you's."
    "But in this instance, in a weird sort of way, I feel simultaneously like Eris doesn't deserve that...{i}and{/i} deserves far more than that."
    "So I try to give it some actual thought."

    eris  p1 e1 "The second thing I wanted to say is this: thank you."
    roman "'Thank you'?"
    eris "--For the same thing, basically. You were a ton of help and I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without you."
    eris "Don't know if you've noticed, or if you, well, care about any of this stuff, but you did some pretty impressive work, and it shows."
    eris "It was my idea, but you did like eighty percent of the job."
    "I chuckle. More to break this growing uneasiness than anything. Moisten up my throat that's suddenly feeling all perched."
    roman "Just eighty?"
    eris p2 e7 "Fine, eighty five? Something around that."
    eris "Which brings me to..."
    "She turns towards me, back straightened up, suddenly looking all formal and proper, and shoves a hand into her pocket."
    eris "This."
    "She pulls out something and hands it over to me. Curiously, I peek down to look at it, and--"
    roman "{i}What?{/i}"
    "I very nearly choke on my cig, sending me into what could charitably sound like a cross between a coughing fit and a snicker."
    "In Eris' hand, neat as I'd have expected from her, without even crumpled ends, is a roll of bills probably as wide around as my neck, held together in a rubber band stretched so thin you can see the discolored strands where it's desperately trying to snap apart."
    roman "You're trying to pay me...in cash?"
    eris p1 e6 "I thought you'd appreciate the sentiment at least."
    roman "What...?"
    roman "You...uh, want me to smuggle you south of the border, or something?"
    roman "'Cause if you got in shit with some scary individuals, I'm telling you right now, you're on your own."
    eris p2 e7 "Why, aren't you hilarious?"
    eris p1 e1 "Now, take it."
    "It's funny how irony works."
    "Now I'm the one who's moving like they're trying to get past a sleeping tiger. Slowly, carefully, lifting my hand towards her before snatching the cash and pulling it back towards me."
    "Part of me says I should fiddle with it for a tad--like, throw it and catch it, or sniff it, or feel it around for flaws just to make sure it's real--but honestly, I wouldn't know how to tell anyway. It'd just be superfluous."
    "Besides, Eris actually looks genuine. I think that scares me more than anything else."
    roman "..."
    roman "...okay."

    eris p1 e6 "Our bet."

    eris p1 e1 "But only with your help. And not the way I planned it in first place."
    eris "I tried justifying this to myself in all kinds of ways, but the truth is, I just can't think of that as my victory. The point was to show who was better at this, right?"
    roman "...I feel like that depends a lot on what 'this' is."
    "She shrugs, looking the other way and sucking the occasional bubble out of her e-cig."

    "Nothing."

    "Definitely not the one I'd use if I'd just given someone the kind of money that...well normally goes in a briefcase. Typically on a table alongside a pistol and the head of gagged policeman."

    eris "This isn't the place for me. I'm not sure what is, but I'm now sure that this isn't it."

    eris "There's a lot I still need to improve on, and I can't expect others to do the work for me. I can't overwork myself with two jobs again either. "
    eris "I'm ready to forge a life for myself that I can finally take full control of."
    eris p2 e7 "With a few thousand tech companies on this side of town alone, there's bound to be one that'd be able to fit my criteria."
    "I squint at her, like that'd somehow make it so I could really see into her."
    "Like I was suspecting that smiling face of hers was a mask, and she was hiding deeper emotions underneath it."
    "I don't know whether or not that smile is real, but in the end I know that she's serious."

    eris p1 e2 "I still don't buy into the entire 'work should be fun' lecture you gave me, but the gist of it was pretty on the spot."
    eris  p1 e1 "It made me realize that all this time I've been mostly... I don't know how to say it without sounding like a moron. Kind of like... I was only driven forward by inertia, you know what I mean?"
    eris "I never could stop myself from pushing forward, so I just kept doing that. For years and years and years."
