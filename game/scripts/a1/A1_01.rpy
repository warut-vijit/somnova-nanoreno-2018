    "There's something that I hate about this city."
    "Maybe it's the staleness of the air, or the lack of available parking."
    "But if I had to choose one thing though, it's the people."
    "They all look the same, with everyone swiping the air through their AR rigs."
    "Most of the time they rudely bump into you, barely acknowledging you as they keep going."
    "Society really likes the shiny stuff, and those AR rigs are no exception."
    "Admittedly, the tech is pretty interesting, but it's just a pain in the ass to move around everyone while they're clearly focused on something else."
    "No one 'takes a walk' anymore, now you have to be on your rig for a game or a phone call."
    "It's really stifling to me. I want to talk to people, but no one's ever without a device these days."
    "I'd give anything to get out of this city at this point. Maybe head out of state, get a new job, that sort of thing."
    "A fresh start."

    "A place that hasn't caught the AR plague."
    "I guess you could call me a hipster, but I wouldn't be offended if you did."
    "I like the way people did things back in the 90s and the Aughts--without bunch of bombardment by shiny tech that commands your attention 24/7."
    "And that's what this place--the Arcady Jazz Club--is all about."
    "I got a job as a waiter here mainly because I wanted to soak in this atmosphere--a breath of fresh air away from the stagnant city outside."
    "Parker, my boss, manages this club exactly the way I like it. He's cultivated a unique atmosphere."

    roman "AR performers, Parker? Really? I thought this was a more traditional jazz club."
    parker "Well, I never said that. I got a friend in the industry, so I decided to buy an older model from him cheap a few months ago."
    parker p1 e1 "I just never got around to using it."
    parker "But I have a business to run, so I have to try to cater to what's popular out there."
    parker "Relax, Roman. It'll draw a crowd. You know what that means."
    roman "More tips?"
    parker p1 e5 "That's the spirit, Roman! Now, she's going to come in about a half hour. If you can set up that AR stage for her when she gets in, that would be a huge help."
    roman "...Sure. Where's the console?"
    parker p1 e1 "In the back. Just hit switches three and seven to get the lights when it asks you."
